PROJECT MANAGEMENT В IT-КОМПАНИИ

Подход к управлению проектами

Мы используем Agile-подход с элементами Scrum, Kanban и Lean в зависимости от специфики проекта. Цель - максимизировать value для клиента при минимизации waste.

Типы проектов

1. Product Development (внутренние продукты)
- Long-term roadmap
- Continuous delivery
- Product Owner-driven
- Scrum framework

2. Client Projects (разработка для клиентов)
- Fixed scope или Time & Material
- Client collaboration
- Milestone-based delivery
- Hybrid Agile approach

3. Internal Projects (infrastructure, tools)
